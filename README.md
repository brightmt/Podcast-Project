# Podcast-Project

I was bored and hadn't programmed in awhile, so I found a Python API and made a tool which allows you to query the ListenNotes API from a CLI.  This was just for fun, so error checking, clarity of UI would not be what I'd professionally produce.

I just had the hunger that only an unfamiliar API could handle!

(please tell me someone actually gets this reference)

## Installation

Clone it in from Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brightmt/Podcast-Project.git
```

### Requirements

Make sure you have the ListenNotes API!

Currently, a value of None exists for the API key, which is suitable for testing purposes or if you just want to mess around without being quizzed to register for an API key.

You will need Python 3.5 to use the API.

Install the API with Pip.

```bash
pip install --upgrade podcast-api
```

## Usage

The program has a CLI which asks for explicit user input.  You can then copy/paste from the output what you're interested in.

Start it with 

```bash
python3 app.py
```

## Support

Not guaranteed!  Message me on LinkedIn.  But the projects on this Github are pretty much done on random whims, so I may not have any interest in supporting them if something else has hit the top of my mental queue.

## Acknowledgements

ListenNotes, for their great API.

And my boss, for telling me to program something, anything, because that's what brought this project to me on a whim.
